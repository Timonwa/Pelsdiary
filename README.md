#### My first HTML file and the first thing I ever coded.
This is a blog website done in html. It tests my html and page linking skills.

It has the index page, about page, section page and subsections pages, it also has the individual posts about 4 of them.
Each of the pages all linking correctly to one another.

###### At the end of it all, a sprinkle of Css was added.
